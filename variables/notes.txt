varibales:
    these are named as block of memory used to store the data.

Declaration:
    In the Declaration here we are declaring a space to the memory.
    exp: let x; (just we have declared x)

    let x = 20; (here we assign some valur in the varibale it calls initialization).

Difference between let, const and var.

    var                                              let                                                           const 
1. scope:global                                    local                                                              local
2. Declaration: it is possible todo just the      it is possible todo just the Declaration                  Declaration is not possible 
Declaration                                                 
exp: var x                                              exp: let x                                             const x;

3. Declaration and initialization:
we can in different line or same line           we can in different line or same line               we can in  same line only

4. re-Declaration and re-initialization:
both are possible                               only re-initialization is possible                  both are not possible

5. hoisting:
it is possible in var                                 not possible in let                             not possible in const
