                       Data Type
1. Premitive Data Type      vs        2. Non Premitive Data Type

* By using Primitive data Type       * By using non Primitive data Type
  we can store the single data         we can store the multiple data 
  in the single block of memory.       under the single variable
  4 Type                               example:- arrays, Object, function  , 
  * Number
  * String                             let arr = [1,2,3,5]   , typeof arr = Object
  * Boolean
  * Undefine




  2.Number :- All the numeric datas are considered as number.
  example:- 
          let x= 123

   3. String :- * The Data which are enclosed within single quate, or double quate
                * Data Type of String is {String}
   Example:- 
         let x = "Sangeeta"
         let y = '123'


    4. In Boolean, it is just include true or false
      Example:- 
          let x = true;
          let y = false;

    5. Undefine : - * Undefined Will occurs when the variable is just declared
                    and it is not initialised to any value.
                    * Undefine also occursduring hoisting.
                    *the data type of undefined is undefined

                    Example:- var x;
                    console.log(x)  // undefined;

differnece between undefined and null

* Undefined will occurs when           * When the variable is initialised
  Variable is just declared               to null then null will occure;
  and not initialised
  Example :- var x;                      let x =null;   
  console.log(x)                         console.log(x) 

  * data type of Undefine               * data type of null is Object;
    is undefined;
